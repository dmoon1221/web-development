4. Use this address to "clone" the repository to your computer. This will link up the project on GitHub with a folder on your local computer.

  1. Open up Terminal (Mac) or Git Bash (Windows)
  2. Use `cd` to navigate to a directory that you want the project to go under.
  3. Use `git clone` followed by the SSH address of your repository that you copied in the previous step.
  4. Now when you `ls` you should see a folder with your repository name. This is the copy of the Git repository on your computer.
