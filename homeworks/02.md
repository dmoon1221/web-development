# Week 2 Homework: CSS

This week's homework will involve completing a game that relies on your knowledge of CSS selectors, and then finishing up the Codeacademy HTML & CSS course that we started last week. Similarly to last week, you will submit a CSS exercise from the course by committing your solution to your homework Git repository.

## CSS Diner

Complete the game [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) to learn about the different types of CSS selectors. Feel free to use Google (and your classmates) for help if you get stuck!

## Codeacademy CSS Sections

This week, we will wrap up the [Codeacademy Web Development track](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web) with the following lessons on CSS: **Introduction to CSS**, **CSS Classes and IDs**, and **CSS Element Positioning**. When finished, you will submit the HTML and CSS code for the final project of the course, **Build a Resume**. Be sure to save your code for this exercise!

## Submit code to your repository

Just as you did last week, please submit the completed files `index.html` and `stylesheet.css` from the **Build a Resume** exercise to your GitHub repository, this time under a folder called `week2`.

If you need a refresher on how to do that, see the last section of [last week's homework](01.md).
