# About this course

This course will teach the basic design and implementation of a web application, with an emphasis on front-end development using Facebook's React framework. By the end of the course, you should have a basic toolkit to build fully functional web applications for hackathons, personal projects, or freelance work. 

The course will provide an overview of component based web frameworks combining HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase backend-as-a-service. It will also cover industry best practices around agile development, version control, use of transpilers and build tools, and designing for optimal user experience.

# Collaboration and Academic Integrity

It is acceptable, even encouraged to form study groups and collaborate in understanding course materials. However, all work on homework assignments should be your own. The work on a group project should be done exclusively by members of that group.

# Homework

You will be given short homework assignments throughout the course. Homework will be expected to take about 2-3 hours each week to complete and should be submitted online through GitHub. Please refrain from emailing in homework assignments as they can get lost.

# Project

The final 4 weeks of the course will be dedicated to a final project, in which you will build a live web application in groups of 3-5. The application should solve a realistic business problem. That doesn't mean that it necessarily has to be business oriented, it could be a game. You should aim to create something to address a need of some group of people in the world.

Your individual participation in this project will be measured by the number and quality of the code/documentation you write as measured by the GitHub version control system. The ONLY work that is counted toward your project grade are explicit working lines of code committed to the master version control system, issues in the issue tracker, meaningful edits in the project wiki, and quality of the final demo and presentation. Students often wonder why team members get higher grades for the same project when they "did more work." If the work isn’t tracked within the project tracking system, it doesn’t count.
