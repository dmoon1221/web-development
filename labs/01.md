## What is version control?

Version control describes a system that keeps track of changes to a code project over time. Each change to code is tracked so that if at any time, a developer wants to turn back time to a previous version of the code, he/she is able to do so. Every project that you start working on as a web developer benefits from being tracked in a version control system, because it will record the history of all the additions and changes that happen over time to the project. When working in a group, the version control system will also help to resolve conflicts when different team members make different changes to the same line of code.

## Git

Git is the most widely used version control system in the software development world today. It is an open source program that contains all the logic to track the entire history of changes in a project, called commits, along with comments describing the changes. Many software projects, both commercial and open-source are version controlled with the Git and hosted on it's website, [GitHub](https://www.github.com/). 

For this course, we will create GitHub **repositories** for all our projects. A repository is a container for a code project (similar to a folder on your computer where you store all the project files). Publishing all the changes to your code on GitHub as you work on it will ensure that if anything issues happen with your computer, all the saved code is secured online and you can easily recover it.

## Install Git

### Windows

1. Download the [Git installer for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. Run the install script.
  1. Make sure the option to install **Git Bash** is checked
  2. Select **Vim** as Git's default editor.
  3. Select **Use Git from Git Bash only**.
  4. Select **Use the OpenSSL library**.
  5. Select **Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings**.
  6. Select **Use MinTTY**.
  
### Mac

1. Download Homebrew by pasting the following into Terminal:
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
2. If you are asked if you want to install the **Command Line Developer Tools** by Apple, confirm by clicking **Install**.
3. Paste the following into Terminal to install git from Homebrew:
```
brew install git
```

## Create a GitHub account

If you don't have one already, register for an account on [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com/).

## Connect your computer to your GitHub account with SSH

Follow the [instructions here](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/) to establish an SSH connection from your computer to your account on GitHub. SSH is a protocol that will ensure secure authentication into your account when you submit changes from your local machine.

## Basic Git Tutorial

The following tutorial will teach the basic Git commands, including how to create a repository, add and change files, and more: [Git Tutorial](http://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)

## Basic Git Commands

Here are the basic steps you'll need to get started with a new repository on Git:

1. Tell Git who you are. You'll only have to do this once:
```
git config --global user.name "Sam Smith"
git config --global user.email sam@example.com
```

2. Create a new repository. It's easiest to do this on [Github.com](https://www.github.com/), following [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/).

3. Clone the repository to your local machine
```
git clone /path/to/repository
```

4. Make some changes, adding or editing a file for instance.

5. View the status of the changes made. (You can check the status at any time)
```
git status
```

6. Add the changed files to Git staging area.
```
git add <filename>
```
or to add everything:
```
git add *
```

7. Commit the changes with a message:
```
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

8. Push the changes to GitHub:
```
git push origin master
```

## What is HTML?

Now that we know how to use version control to start a new project, let's talk about the core language of website content: HTML. **HTML** stands for **Hyper Text Markup Language**. It is a language that uses blocks called **tags** or **elements** to describe the structure of a website. HTML is the markup language that a browser like Google Chrome reads to determine what type of content and interactive elements are on the page.

A simple HTML document may look like something like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <h1>My Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

As you can see, it consists of a series of opening tags (like `<p>`) and closing tags (`</p>`) that enclose content at different levels. This is what each of the tags mean in the example above:

- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` indicates to the browser that this is an HTML document.
- The `<html>` element encloses all the HTML on the page. This is also known as a **root element**.
- The `<head>` element contains "meta" data about the page that search engines use like a title and description.
- The `<title>` element specifies a title for the web page.
- The `<body>` element contains all of the content that is visible in the browser.
- The `<h1>` element defines the largest first level heading. There are also `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>` for smaller headings. 
- The `<p>` element defines a paragraph.

## HTML Basics

### 

Go through the first 3 sections of the [Codeacademy HTML & CSS course](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web) to learn all the basics about HTML tags. You should complete the sections titled **Introduction to HTML**, **HTML Structure: Using Lists** and **HTML Structure: Tables, Divs and Spans**. Stop before the section titled **Introduction to CSS**.

## Creating a repository on GitHub

This week, we will create a repository on GitHub for the lab assignments for this class. 

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://www.github.com) and click *New Repository* under the menu bar.

2. Fill in the fields for your new repository and click **Create repository**. You can choose whichever name you'd like for the repository

3. Click the green Clone or Download button and copy the SSH address of the newly created repository.

4. Use this address to "clone" the repository to your computer. This will link up the project on GitHub with a folder on your local computer.

  1. Open up Terminal (Mac) or Git Bash (Windows)
  2. Use `cd` to navigate to a directory that you want the project to go under.
  3. Use `git clone` followed by the SSH address of your repository that you copied in the previous step.
  4. Now when you `ls` you should see a folder with your repository name. This is the copy of the Git repository on your computer.

## Branching

Branches on Git are a way to keep track of work that is 


## Download a text editor

If you don't already have a text editor for editing HTML, CSS and JS code on your computer, we recommend downloading either [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/). While we don't need it yet, since we are operating in the Codeacademy environment, it will soon be helpful for you to work on own web development projects locally. Advanced text editors provide many useful features such as syntax highlighting and keyboard shortcuts that will make programming a lot easier!

## Lab Assignment: Student Organization Website

Your task is to produce a website for a student organization or club using HTML. The website should describe what the organization does, when the regular meeting times are, and list the student leaders. It can be based off of a real or imaginary student organization. Here's an example of what the it might look like:

![Homework 5](../images/01/homework5.png)

The requirements for the website's homepage HTML are that it must contain *at minimum*:

- A `title` (within the head tag) that shows up on the browser tab
- Headings and paragraphs
- A list (ordered or unordered)
- An image
- Bold and italicized font
- A link to another page to sign up for the mailing list (which we will create next)

Other than that, feel free to be creative and add whichever features or information students may find useful about your organization!

Your next challenge is to link the homepage to another page that contains a form where visitors can sign up for the organization's mailing list. You haven't yet learned how to make an HTML form, so will have to do some research on the internet to find the appropriate elements to use. The form **does not** have to be functional, meaning it does not have to do anything when someone clicks submit (but all the elements should still be there).

The form should look like this, with two text fields for Name and Email, as well as a dropdown for Class Year:

![Homework 6](../images/01/homework6.png)

![Homework 7](../images/01/homework7.png)

Be sure that there is a link on the home page to reach the email signup page and there is another link from the email signup page back to the homepage.

Use the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to submit your code to the repository. See [this tutorial](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners) if you need a refresher on how to use Git.
