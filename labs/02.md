# Week 2 Lab: Build a website using CSS and Bootstrap

For this week's lab, we will be building a website based on the [Bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com) CSS library. Bootstrap provides a collection of many basic styled elements that conform to today's responsive web standards. Many startups rely on the Bootstrap framework to quickly set up a landing page without having to worry about defining all the CSS from scratch. Today we will build a landing page for a software company for private file storage called **Lockbox**.

For quick setup of your project, copy the starter template from [Bootstrap Starter Template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template) to a new folder and name the file `index.html`. This template will provide all the necessary Bootstrap styles, as well as some supporting JavaScript.

The Bootstrap foundation styles won't be quite enough to cover all the styles and colors we want so also add your own custom stylesheet in a file called `style.css`. Link your own stylesheet beneath the standard Bootstrap one in `index.html` such that your `<head>` section looks like this:

```html
<head>
    <!-- Required meta tags -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-Gn5384xqQ1aoWXA+058RXPxPg6fy4IWvTNh0E263XmFcJlSAwiGgFAW/dAiS6JXm" crossorigin="anonymous">

    <!-- My own custom CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

    <title>Hello, world!</title>
</head>
```

This will tell the browser: First load Bootstrap styles and then load everything in `style.css` on top of it. This way, your own custom styles will override the Bootstrap ones where applicable.

## Tips:

1. Use the [Bootstrap Components page](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/) for examples of how to add different elements to the page styled with Bootstrap classes.
