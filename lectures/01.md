# What is version control?

Version control describes a system that keeps track of changes to a code project over time. Each change to code is tracked so that if at any time, a developer wants to turn back time to a previous version of the code, he/she is able to do so. Every project that you start working on as a web developer benefits from being tracked in a version control system, because it will record the history of all the additions and changes that happen over time to the project. When working in a group, the version control system will also help to resolve conflicts when different team members make different changes to the same line of code.

# Git

Git is the most widely used version control system in the software development world today. It is an open source program that contains all the logic to track the entire history of changes in a project, called commits, along with comments describing the changes. Many software projects, both commercial and open-source are version controlled with the Git and hosted on it's website, [GitHub](https://www.github.com/). 

For this course, we will create GitHub **repositories** for all our projects. A repository is a container for a code project (similar to a folder on your computer where you store all the project files). Publishing all the changes to your code on GitHub as you work on it will ensure that if anything issues happen with your computer, all the saved code is secured online and you can easily recover it.
