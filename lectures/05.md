# Week 5: React Part 1

## Introduction to React

## Components

We can think of everything in React as a **component**. If you think about the elements of a website, the `div`s, `span`s, `p`s etc., each of these is a reusable piece that has a specific purpose. React components take this concept one step further and provide a framework where you can provide interactive pieces of functionality in custom elements, which React interprets as custom tags. For instance, if you had a checkers game app, you could have a `<Checker />` component for each game piece.

It is very important when designing our web applications to break them down in a way such that we maximize our use of components. Any time you see a section of the app that can be treated as a contained element and piece of functionality, and/or is used multiple times in the app (like in a list or grid for instance), you should consider making it a separate component.

The React guide has provided a great guide to how to think about "componentizing" your web application projects, which you can check out here: [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html).

## React Dev Tools

A good tool we can use to inspect the React structure of an app is the React Dev Tools extension for Chrome. Go ahead and find the extension in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/) called **React Developer Tools** and add it to Chrome. This extension will give you the ability to inspect a page broken down by its React components, in addition to the classic inspection of standard HTML elements. It will also allow us to check the properties and state of React components, which we will learn about later.

The React Chrome extension is the first option in the list here:

Let's now try to use the React Dev Tools extension to inspect a page that runs on React, like [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) or [Codeacademy](https://www.codeacademy.com). What are the differences between the `Elements` tab and `React` tab in the Chrome inspector and which components do you see?
